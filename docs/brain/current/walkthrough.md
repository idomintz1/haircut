# Workspace Migration Walkthrough

The workspace files have been successfully migrated from the scratch directory to a permanent location.

## Changes Made

- Created the target directory: `/Users/idomintz/Documents/git/haircut`
- Copied the following source files:
  - `index.html`
  - `script.js`
  - `seeds.js`
  - `style.css`

## Documentation and Design Files

Organized all task and design documents into `docs/brain/`:
- `current/`: Task and walkthrough for this migration.
- `heatmap/`: Design spec, implementation plan, task, walkthrough, and verification images from the heatmap development.
- `initial_setup/`: Implementation plan and task from the initial project setup.

## Verification Results

The files were verified to be present in the target directory with the same file sizes as the original scratch files.

```bash
ls -lh /Users/idomintz/Documents/git/haircut
```
- `index.html` (7.7K)
- `script.js` (14.6K)
- `seeds.js` (7.3K)
